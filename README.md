## Problem Statement

10Alytics aims to evaluate its overall sales performance across several key business metrics including total revenue, product cost, profit margins, product category performance, customer demographics, and regional sales distribution. Management is particularly interested in:

Identifying high- and low-performing product categories

Understanding customer purchasing behavior across gender and age groups

Analyzing state-level sales performance and salesperson contributions

Classifying transactions and customer segments based on profitability

There is a growing need to strengthen targeting strategies, optimize the product mix, and improve regional sales execution to enhance profitability and drive sustainable business growth.

## Analysis & Visualization Summary

### Overall Sales Performance

Total Transactions: 34,866

Total Quantity Sold: 69,820

Total Revenue: ₦22.34M

Total Cost: ₦20.08M

Total Profit: ₦2.26M

Trend of Profit by Year

### Early 2015 shows negative or near-zero profit.

Profit rises steadily into 2016, peaking around Q2.

A sharp decline in July suggests a seasonal dip or operational disruption.

### Profit by Customer Gender

Male: 52% of profit

Female: 48%

→ Balanced performance, indicating no gender-driven sales gap.

### Profit by Customer Age Group

Adults are the dominant profit contributors.

Youth follow with moderate impact.

Older groups (Elder & Aged) show minimal contribution and represent a smaller commercial opportunity.

### Profit by Product Category

Accessories deliver the highest profit, with revenue significantly above cost and the strongest margin among all categories.

Clothing produces a moderate profit margin, with revenue safely above cost but not as strong as Accessories.

Phones, though generating the highest revenue, also incur very high costs, resulting in the lowest profit margin across all categories.

### Profit by Top 10 States

Strongest regions:

Lagos, Abuja, Akwa Ibom, Anambra

Lowest-performing:

Adamawa, Edo, Benue

→ Clear regional disparities and untapped market potential.

---

## Insights Generation & Synthesis

High revenue but slim margins overall → cost inefficiencies or aggressive pricing in some categories (Phones).

Accessories are the real profit engine, not Phones → opportunity to reposition product strategy.

Phones category requires margin review → high revenue but low profit indicates leakage.

States differ widely in profitability → performance is heavily skewed to a few regions.

Adults and Youth drive the bulk of value → marketing investment should prioritize these demographics.

Seasonal fluctuations highlight need for stabilizing interventions around low months.

Salesperson performance variations suggest the need for targeted upskilling.

---

## Recommendations
A. Product & Pricing Strategy

Prioritize marketing and inventory for Accessories (highest margin).

Reassess Phones cost structure — negotiate suppliers, refine pricing, or redesign bundles.

Improve Clothing margins through cost control and promotional alignment.

B. Regional Growth Strategy

Deploy micro-campaigns in low-performing states (Adamawa, Edo, Benue).

Reassign high-performing sales reps to support weaker regions.

C. Customer Segment Strategy

Launch targeted campaigns for Adults and Youth, the highest-value segments.

Create tiered loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases.

D. Operational Performance

Build incentive structures tied to profit contribution, not just volume.

Use dashboards to monitor salesperson productivity in real time.

E. Seasonal Planning

Introduce Q1 promotional offers to offset early-year dips.

Align inventory management with seasonal demand trends.

F. Payment Optimization

Promote online payments using small discounts or faster processing benefits.

Reduce reliance on cost-heavy POS channels.
