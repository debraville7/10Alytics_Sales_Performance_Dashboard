Identifying high- and low-performing product categories

Understanding customer purchasing behavior across gender and age groups

Analyzing state-level sales performance and salesperson contributions

Classifying transactions and customer segments based on profitability

There is a growing need to strengthen targeting strategies, optimize the product mix, and improve regional sales execution to enhance profitability and drive sustainable business growth.
